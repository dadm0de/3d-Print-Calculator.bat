I created this batch file to help my son estimate cost for 3D Prints he wanted to sell at school. It makes some assumption to make it easier to get to a reasonable result. It assumes tax rate of 10%, filament cost of $30 with 100% markup, KW power cost based on 1200watt max power 3d printer and .15c kW per hour national average. Automatically adds 5 minutes of labor by default unless otherwise specified at a rate of  $20 per hour.
